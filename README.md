## Install and configure NodeJS and mongoDB

To install and configure NodeJS and mongoDB watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5fiWcVcADw) video on youtube

## To run the app follow the following guidlines

1. Clone the github repo (or pull if you have already cloned it)
2. Install required modules by going to your project directory in terminal (example in my case it is 'C:\Users\Hammad\Desktop\Brewd-b'). Then type 'npm install'. This will take a while.
3. Afer installation is complete, type 'node index' in the same directory to run your application. You will get a message 'now listening for requests'.
4. Open browser and type 'localhost:4000/index.html'. You will be able to see the front end web application.

Note: you need to insert dummy data to see the app working i.e. fetch cafes as per user's choice of milk and coffee roaster. dummy data can be added using postman and mongo DB can be viewed using Robo Mongo.

CHEERS!
